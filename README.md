# credit-card-EDA-pyth
Exploratory data analysis and visualizations with Python on data from an arbitrary bank. 

## Dataset
This was a dataset about credit-cards and credit lending transactions. There were multiple tables in this database which had to be joined. These tables included data about customer details, spending activity, repayment of bills activity.

## Packages used:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib 
- datetime
- seaborn

## Few examples of questions addressed (alongwith others in notebook)
- which city contributes most to customers spending on their credit cards?
- is there any seasonality in terms of card spending? if yes, are there any particular months / days that people spend more or less during?
- can we group customers in our database by forming bins based on their age and then find their median spending?

## Tasks performed:
- joining tables (merging)
- cleaning, typecasting, missing value treatment
- feature creation
- binning
- aggregations
- visualizations
- creating user defined functions for more dynamic aggregations!

Other questions and responses done in the notebook attached.
